 In order to add sound to a project, an entry for that file should be placed in the 
 
 /sound/data/gfx_data.s
 
 And should follow this convention
 
 sound_data  _C_CODE_NAME,"/path/to/file.mod"
 
 ----------------------
 NOTE:
 
 Additional '.s" files can be added for better organization, as long as they are placed in the same folder as the 'gfx_data.s' file
 
 
 Notes on creating comapatible .mod and .wav files for the removers library.
